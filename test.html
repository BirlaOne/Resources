            { id: 1, question: "Explain the core features that define a service.", answer: "<p>Services are fundamentally different from physical goods, and their unique nature is defined by five core characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Intangibility:</strong> This is the most defining feature. A service is an experience, not an object. It cannot be seen, touched, or tasted before it is purchased. This creates uncertainty for customers, who must rely on tangible cues—such as a clean office, professional staff uniforms, or a well-designed website—to judge the quality of the service before buying.</li><li><strong>Inseparability:</strong> Services are unique because they are often produced and consumed at the same time. The person providing the service (e.g., a doctor, a hairstylist) is a critical part of the service itself. This direct interaction means the quality of the service is inseparable from the skills and attitude of the provider.</li><li><strong>Variability (or Heterogeneity):</strong> The quality of a service can differ greatly depending on who provides it, when, and how. For example, two visits to the same restaurant can be very different based on the chef or server on duty. Companies try to manage this by standardizing processes and providing extensive employee training to ensure a consistent customer experience.</li><li><strong>Perishability:</strong> Services cannot be saved, stored, or resold for later use. An empty seat on an airplane or an unbooked hotel room represents lost revenue that can never be recovered. This is why service businesses use strategies like dynamic pricing and reservation systems to manage demand and maximize capacity.</li><li><strong>Lack of Ownership:</strong> When you buy a service, you are paying for an experience or the right to use something for a period of time; you do not gain ownership of a physical object. For instance, you pay for a ticket to watch a movie, but you don't own the film. Marketing for services, therefore, focuses on communicating the value and benefits of the experience.</li></ul>" },
            { id: 2, question: "How are services classified? Describe the different types.", answer: "<p>Services can be classified using several frameworks to help businesses develop effective marketing and operational strategies. The main classification methods are:</p><h3>Based on the Nature of the Service Act:</h3><ul><li><strong>People Processing:</strong> Tangible actions on a person's body (e.g., healthcare, haircuts). Customer must be present.</li><li><strong>Possession Processing:</strong> Tangible actions on a physical object (e.g., car repair, laundry). Customer's presence not required.</li><li><strong>Mental Stimulus Processing:</strong> Intangible actions directed at a person's mind (e.g., education, entertainment).</li><li><strong>Information Processing:</strong> Intangible actions on intangible assets (e.g., banking, legal services).</li></ul><h3>Based on Delivery Mode:</h3><ul><li><strong>People-Based:</strong> Quality depends on the provider's skill (e.g., consultants, artists).</li><li><strong>Equipment-Based:</strong> Delivered through technology (e.g., ATMs, automated car washes).</li></ul><h3>Based on Customer Involvement:</h3><ul><li><strong>High-Involvement:</strong> Requires active customer participation (e.g., personal training).</li><li><strong>Low-Involvement:</strong> Requires minimal customer interaction (e.g., watching a movie).</li></ul><h3>Based on Business Orientation:</h3><ul><li><strong>Profit-Oriented:</strong> Primary goal is financial profit (e.g., airlines, hotels).</li><li><strong>Non-Profit-Oriented:</strong> Primary goal is social welfare (e.g., public libraries, charities).</li></ul>" },
            { id: 3, question: "What are the key expectations of modern customers in services?", answer: "<p>In today's competitive landscape, modern customers have sophisticated expectations that go far beyond the basic delivery of a service. Key expectations include:</p><ul><li><strong>Connected and Consistent Journeys:</strong> A seamless experience across all channels (website, app, store) without repeating information.</li><li><strong>Deep Personalization:</strong> Being treated as a unique individual with tailored recommendations based on past data and preferences.</li><li><strong>Speed, Efficiency, and Convenience:</strong> Quick response times, fast issue resolution, and multiple support options (omnichannel support).</li><li><strong>Trust, Transparency, and Data Protection:</strong> Complete transparency on data usage and robust security measures.</li><li><strong>Empathy and Being Heard:</strong> Genuine understanding and value for their concerns, turning negative situations into positive ones.</li><li><strong>Proactive Service:</strong> Companies anticipating potential issues and offering solutions before the customer is even aware of the problem.</li></ul>" },
            { id: 4, question: "What are the main factors that influence consumer expectations of a service?", answer: "<p>Consumer expectations for a service are shaped by a complex mix of internal and external factors. The main factors are:</p><ul><li><strong>Past Experience:</strong> A customer's previous interactions with the same or different companies set a benchmark.</li><li><strong>Marketing and Communication:</strong> A company's own promises, both explicit (ads) and implicit (high pricing), shape expectations.</li><li><strong>Word-of-Mouth and Social Proof:</strong> Recommendations from friends, family, and online reviews are highly influential.</li><li><strong>Personal Needs and Situational Factors:</strong> Unique requirements and temporary circumstances, like being in a hurry, alter expectations.</li><li><strong>Perceived Service Alternatives:</strong> Knowing that other high-quality providers are available raises expectations for any single company.</li></ul>" },
